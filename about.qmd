I am currently an associate professor in the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech. I work in application areas such as robotics, AI, and cognitive science, specializing in methods from the intersection of machine learning and dynamical systems theory. I teach courses in linear systems, software, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Prior to 2014 I did research in biomedical imaging, image analysis, and computer vision.

In more technical terms, I study the dynamics, design, and evolution of stochastic systems at non-equilibrium steady-state and thier application to robotics, artificial intelligence, biology, neuroscience, and cognitive science.
