## Current Projects

### A Software Library for Active Inference

The goal of this project is to develop an open, reusable, high-quality library for implementing active inference systems both in simulation and in embedded robotic hardware/software. The current focus is on the continuous-time formulation of active inference and the related algorithms: dynamic expectation maximization (libdem), variation filtering (libvf), and generalized filtering (libgf).

### Design Principles of Active Inference Systems

This is a largely theoretical investigation into the generative models that might underlie biological (cognitive) systems. There are many open questions. What mathematical properties might the state spaces have? How much of the generative models are encoded in genes, development, and learning? Is there a clear dividing line between the cognitive and non-cognitive processes? Etc.

### Segmentation and Polyp Detection in CT Colonography

![Example Colon Lumen Surface](images/colon.png){ align=right }

CT Colonography (also known as Virtual Colonoscopy) is a minimally invasive screening
technique for colorectal polyps. Mixed success has been achieved in clinical trials, 
in large part due to variations in reader experience, the large number of images, and 
the complex geometry of the colon. Similar to mammography and lung nodule detection, 
computer polyp detection (CPD) and computer-aided polyp detection (CAPD) promise to 
improve the sensitivity and specificity of CTC. Our long term goal is to develop robust 
CAPD methods. Our current focus is on feature discovery, colon registration, and classifier design.

This research applies image analysis techniques commonly used in humans to primates,
such as Macaques, in order to determine structural changes in brain morphometry due
to the effects of alcohol and various pharmacological agents.

Structural brain changes that occur during the process of normal aging are of great interest to neuroscientists investigating age-related changes in cognitive function. A variety of techniques currently exist to identify group differences in brain anatomy with the greatest focus having been placed on cortical anatomy. Although cortical anatomy is of considerable significance, the underlying white matter tracts are at great risk in the aged brain. Patchy white matter lesions referred to as leukoaraiosis (LA) have long been identified radiologically as T2-weighted hyperintensities in older adults.

Techniques such as voxel-based morphometry (VBM), deformation-based morphometry (DBM), or tissue thickness measurements allow for quantitative comparisons of white matter in a regionally specific manner. However, VBM is dependent upon segmentation algorithms to measure tissue density, a task difficult in images displaying the diffuse contrast changes associated with LA. Similarly, DBM is dependent on registration algorithms to establish a spatial correspondence between images. Unfortunately, current image registration methods do not perform effectively in regions where tissue contrast has changed, such as in leukoaraiosis.

The goal of this project is to evaluate the relationship between changes in cognitive function and cerebral white matter in older adults. Since current VBM and DBM methods cannot be applied to subjects with leukoaraiosis, the project will expand current image registration techniques to accommodate topological changes in the images. The following specific aims are proposed:

Aim 1: Develop a deformable registration method for images represented as embedded maps, employing the level-set framework. We will develop a deformable registration approach representing each image as an embedded map. This registration framework will simultaneously account for changes in intensity and morphology between image pairs.

Aim 2: Identify the relationship between executive cognitive functions and age-related changes in cerebral white matter using the level-set based registration of embedded maps approach. To evaluate white matter integrity, quantitative T1 and T2 maps will be registered using the embedded maps algorithm developed in Aim 1. We will identify white matter intensity and volume changes (i.e. leukoaraiosis) in a regionally specific manner and correlate these changes with cognitive function.

### Registration of MRI Spherical Navigators for Prospective Motion Correction

![Example Spherical Navigator](images/snav.png){ align=right }

Spherical navigators are an attractive approach to motion compensation 
in Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Because they can be
acquired quickly, spherical navigators have the potential to measure
and correct for rigid motion during image acquisition (prospectively
as opposed to retrospectively). A limiting factor to prospective use of
navigators is the time required to estimate the motion parameters. 
We have developed an efficient algorithm for recovery of rotational motion 
using spherical navigators. Our results show that the spherical harmonic 
based estimation algorithm is significantly faster than existing methods 
and so is suited for prospective motion correction.
