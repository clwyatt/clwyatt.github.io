Mixed success has been achieved in clinical trials, in large part due to variations in reader experience, the large number of images, and the complex geometry of the colon. Similar to mammography and lung nodule detection, computer polyp detection (CPD) and computer-aided polyp detection (CAPD) promise to improve the sensitivity and specificity of CTC. Our long term goal is to develop robust CAPD methods. Our current focus is on feature discovery, colon registration, and classifier design.\nCollaborators: Pete Santago, Wake Forest University School of Medicine.\nRelevant Papers:\n\nJ. W. Suh and C. L.

Information on the National Centers for Biomedical Computing can be obtained from http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/bioinformatics.\nStructural brain changes that occur during the process of normal aging are of great interest to neuroscientists investigating age-related changes in cognitive function. A variety of techniques currently exist to identify group differences in brain anatomy with the greatest focus having been placed on cortical anatomy. Although cortical anatomy is of considerable significance, the underlying white matter tracts are at great risk in the aged brain. Patchy white matter lesions referred to as leukoaraiosis (LA) have long been identified radiologically as T2-weighted hyperintensities in older adults.\nTechniques such as voxel-based morphometry (VBM), deformation-based morphometry (DBM), or tissue thickness measurements allow for quantitative comparisons of white matter in a regionally specific manner. However, VBM is dependent upon segmentation algorithms to measure tissue density, a task difficult in images displaying the diffuse contrast changes associated with LA. Similarly, DBM is dependent on registration algorithms to establish a spatial correspondence between images. Unfortunately, current image registration methods do not perform effectively in regions where tissue contrast has changed, such as in leukoaraiosis.\nThe goal of this project is to evaluate the relationship between changes in cognitive function and cerebral white matter in older adults. Since current VBM and DBM methods cannot be applied to subjects with leukoaraiosis, the project will expand current image registration techniques to accommodate topological changes in the images. The following specific aims are proposed:\nAim 1: Develop a deformable registration method for images represented as embedded maps, employing the level-set framework. We will develop a deformable registration approach representing each image as an embedded map. This registration framework will simultaneously account for changes in intensity and morphology between image pairs.\nAim 2: Identify the relationship between executive cognitive functions and age-related changes in cerebral white matter using the level-set based registration of embedded maps approach. To evaluate white matter integrity, quantitative T1 and T2 maps will be registered using the embedded maps algorithm developed in Aim 1. We will identify white matter intensity and volume changes (i.e. leukoaraiosis) in a regionally specific manner and correlate these changes with cognitive function.\nCollaborators: Paul Laurienti, Bob Kraft, Wake Forest University School of Medicine.\nRelevant Papers:\n\nX.

Because they can be acquired quickly, spherical navigators have the potential to measure and correct for rigid motion during image acquisition (prospectively as opposed to retrospectively). A limiting factor to prospective use of navigators is the time required to estimate the motion parameters. We have developed an efficient algorithm for recovery of rotational motion using spherical navigators. Our results show that the spherical harmonic based estimation algorithm is significantly faster than existing methods and so is suited for prospective motion correction.\nCollaborators: Bob Kraft, Wake Forest University School of Medicine.\nRelevant Papers:\n\nIMPI paper\n\n\n\nMultiscale CT and Virtual Histology\nAs part of my previous work with the now-defunct Biomedical Imaging Division, I conducted research on various aspects of image analysis related to advanced nano/micro CT imaging."
