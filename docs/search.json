I work in application areas such as robotics, AI, and cognitive science, specializing in methods from the intersection of machine learning and dynamical systems theory. I teach courses in linear systems, software, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Prior to 2014 I did research in biomedical imaging, image analysis, and computer vision.\nIn more technical terms, I study the dynamics, design, and evolution of stochastic systems at non-equilibrium steady-state and thier application to robotics, artificial intelligence, biology, neuroscience, and cognitive science.\nContact Information\nChris Wyatt Associate Professor Electrical and Computer Engineering  Virginia Tech  Office: 439 in Whittemore Hall   Email: clwyatt@vt.edu   GitHub: clwyatt"
